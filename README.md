# SQL Internship Project – Task 3: Course Enrollments

# Project Overview
This repository contains the submission for **Task 3** of the SQL Developer Internship. The task demonstrates the use of SQL to retrieve data from a relational table 
using essential querying techniques such as filtering, sorting, and limiting.

The data represents a **Course Enrollment System**, including student details, course names, enrollment dates, fees, and current enrollment statuses.

# Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Data retrieval using `SELECT` statements
- Conditional filtering using `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`
- Result ordering using `ORDER BY`
- Column selection and projection
- Table structure understanding and query execution

# Tools & Technologies
**MySQL Workbench** – Used for writing and executing SQL scripts
**GitHub** – Used for version control and task submission

# Learning Outcome
Through this task, a clear understanding was developed in:
Writing SQL queries for data extraction and filtering
Applying basic query logic to real-world-like datasets
Interpreting task instructions and converting them into practical scripts
